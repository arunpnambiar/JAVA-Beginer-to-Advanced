/*
   Java is object oriented programing language.
   What is a object? the answer for this question is object has state and behaviour.
   for real world example car is a object. it has different behaviours like  drive, horn etc.
  What is a class? the answer for this question is class is a blueprint of objects. it contains variables and method.
  In the above program Helloworld is a program to print Hello world in console. In java the entry point is main method.
  Main method always public and static. because while running ]ava it create .class file. we cannot call class with out object.
  But if we make a class as static we can call by class name. for that main method always static.
  Public: it is a access specifier , public means we can access from outside world.
  System  means a class
  out means a object
  println is a method.
  so System.out.println() ->> means println is method inside PrintStream class and out is object of PrintStream created inside System class
